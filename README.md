# Rootstock NFT Marketplace

NFT marketplace built on Rootstock using thirdweb.

## Features

- NFT listing grid with responsive layout and loading skeletons
- Detailed NFT view with listing information
- Buy and cancel functionality powered by thirdweb's marketplace extensions

Built using the [thirdweb Marketplace SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/marketplace), which provides a clean API surface for marketplace operations, allowing us to focus on the user experience rather than low-level smart contract calls.

## Installation & Development

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-thirdweb-marketplace.git
   cd rsk-thirdweb-marketplace
   bun install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   Rename a `.env.example` file in the root directory using `mv .env.example .env.local` and follow the guide to replace the needed variables.

3. **Start development server**:
   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Overview

The NFT Marketplace consists of two main processes:

1. **Buy an NFT**: Users can buy NFTs connecting their wallets. Once the users sign the buy transaction and pay for the NFT and gas costs, they own the NFT.
2. **Sell an NFT**: Users can list their NFTs and establish the price they want for them individually. To list an NFT, they must specified the address of the ERC1155 NFT representation on the Rootstock (RSK) network, the token ID and the price.

## Technologies Used

- **Thirdweb Marketplace V3**: [Thirdweb Documentation](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3)
- **Thirdweb TS SDK**: [Thirdweb Github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/tree/main#readme)
